		- ~Build research sumarization model~ [https://github.com/justdvnsh/Research-Summarizer](https://github.com/justdvnsh/Research-Summarizer)
		```
			The Model has been made , but due to lack of GPU, the model could not be trained on large dataset, making it not 
			ready for production. Trying different methods to get it done. The current model using Seq2Seq with attention 
			model, and sequence padding . Also tried bucketing with no luck.
